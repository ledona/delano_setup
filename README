# SLEEP ON INACTIVE
This are custom scripts that will sleep a linux machine that has a certain level of recent cpu inactivity.
The scripts are bin/sleep-on-inactive.sc and bin/suspend-notify.sc
To set this up:

1. sudo apt install moreutils datamash
2. (optional) Test the sleep-on-inactive script by running it with the argument --dryrun. This will
   do everything by actually send the machine to sleep. It should also indicate if all the required
   command line tools are installed.
2. copy bin/sleep-on-inactive.sc to a convenient location for sudo. e.g. /bin
3. add bin/sleep-on-inactive.sc to the sudo crontab. Something like the following will do
   */5 * * * * /bin/sleep-on-inactive.sc > /var/log/sleep-on-inactive.log
4. (optional) Test suspend/resume notifications run running
   sudo ./bin/suspend-notify.sc pre
   sudo ./bin/suspend-notify.sc post
5. (optional) To receive notifications in slack for suspend and awaken, copy bin/suspend-notify.sc to
   /lib/systemd/system-sleep/suspend-notify.sc
