This installation assumes that you are using homebrew

1) Install ansible on a machine that will control the install process. (use homebrew)
2) Make sure that you can ssh to the machine that is being setup and that the ssh user has sudo
3) ansible-playbook -i MACHINE_TO_SETUP, emacs.yml -u USERNAME --ask-sudo-pass
   ansible-playbook -i MACHINE_TO_SETUP, environment.yml -u USERNAME --ask-sudo-pass
