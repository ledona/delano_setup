This installation assumes that you are using macports

1) Install ansible on a machine that will control the install process. (use macports)
2) Make sure that you can ssh to the machine that is being setup and that the ssh user has sudo
3) ansible-playbook -i MACHINE_TO_SETUP, emacs.yml -u USERNAME --ask-sudo-pass
   ansible-playbook -i MACHINE_TO_SETUP, environment.yml -u USERNAME --ask-sudo-pass

Troubleshooting:

If there is an error regarding the sudo password then add the --ask-sudo-pass argument to the ansible-playbook command
If running locally add --connection=local
If there is an error about not finding "ohai" run "gem install ohai"
